Welcome to the GLUES Laboratory!

Our research focuses on: 

Theoretical and computational modeling of damage, healing, viscous behavior and fatigue of geomaterials under coupled or extreme conditions.

Experimental investigation and image analysis of micro-structure evolution and pore and crack development in porous media. 

Geoengineering applications involved in infrastructure design, energy exploration, and geological storage.
